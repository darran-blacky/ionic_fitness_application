# ionic_fitness_application

This project is split up into two folders 'client' for the frontend & 'server' for the backend.
The code for the 'server' is running online on heroku and the database is being hosted online via Amazon Web Services so their is no need to try start the the server locally. However, in order to run the server locally you will need to have NPM & Node installed from the following website;

        https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

Chose the download file which is made for your specific operating system.

Once installed you can start the server by running the command inside the 'server' folder:

        'npm start' 

To run the code in the client folder you will need to have NPM & Node installed(Same process as the backend steps above).

Once installed you can start the application by running the command inside the 'client' folder:

        'ionic serve -l'

The application should be running on your localhost then on the port 8202:

        'https://localhost:8202/ionic-lab
